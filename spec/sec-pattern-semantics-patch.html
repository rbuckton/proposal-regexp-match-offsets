    <p>The descriptions below use the following variables:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        _Input_ is a List consisting of all of the characters, in order, of the String being matched by the regular expression pattern. Each character is either a code unit or a code point, depending upon the kind of pattern involved. The notation _Input_[_n_] means the _n_<sup>th</sup> character of _Input_, where _n_ can range between 0 (inclusive) and _InputLength_ (exclusive).
      </li>
      <li>
        _InputLength_ is the number of characters in _Input_.
      </li>
      <li>
        _NcapturingParens_ is the total number of left-capturing parentheses (i.e. the total number of <emu-grammar>Atom :: `(` GroupSpecifier Disjunction `)`</emu-grammar> Parse Nodes) in the pattern. A left-capturing parenthesis is any `(` pattern character that is matched by the `(` terminal of the <emu-grammar>Atom :: `(` GroupSpecifier Disjunction `)`</emu-grammar> production.
      </li>
      <li>
        _DotAll_ is *true* if the RegExp object's [[OriginalFlags]] internal slot contains `"s"` and otherwise is *false*.
      </li>
      <li>
        _IgnoreCase_ is *true* if the RegExp object's [[OriginalFlags]] internal slot contains `"i"` and otherwise is *false*.
      </li>
      <li>
        _Multiline_ is *true* if the RegExp object's [[OriginalFlags]] internal slot contains `"m"` and otherwise is *false*.
      </li>
      <li>
        _Unicode_ is *true* if the RegExp object's [[OriginalFlags]] internal slot contains `"u"` and otherwise is *false*.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Furthermore, the descriptions below use the following internal data structures:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A <em>CharSet</em> is a mathematical set of characters, either code units or code points depending up the state of the _Unicode_ flag. &ldquo;All characters&rdquo; means either all code unit values or all code point values also depending upon the state of _Unicode_.
      </li>
      <li>
        <ins>A <em>Range</em> is an ordered pair (_startIndex_, _endIndex_) that represents the range of characters included in a capture, where _startIndex_ is an integer representing the start index (inclusive) of the range within _Input_ and _endIndex_ is an integer representing the end index (exclusive) of the range within _Input_. For any <em>Range</em>, these indices must satisfy the invariant that _startIndex_ â‰¤ _endIndex_.</ins>
      </li>
      <li>
        A <em>State</em> is an ordered pair (_endIndex_, _captures_) where _endIndex_ is an integer representing an index within _Input_ and _captures_ is a List of _NcapturingParens_ values. States are used to represent partial match states in the regular expression matching algorithms. The _endIndex_ is one plus the index of the last input character matched so far by the pattern, while _captures_ holds the results of capturing parentheses. The _n_<sup>th</sup> element of _captures_ is either a List that represents the <del>value</del><ins><em>Range</em></ins> obtained by the _n_<sup>th</sup> set of capturing parentheses or *undefined* if the _n_<sup>th</sup> set of capturing parentheses hasn't been reached yet. Due to backtracking, many States may be in use at any time during the matching process.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <em>MatchResult</em> is either a State or the special token ~failure~ that indicates that the match failed.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <em>Continuation</em> procedure is an internal closure (i.e. an internal procedure with some arguments already bound to values) that takes one State argument and returns a MatchResult result. If an internal closure references variables which are bound in the function that creates the closure, the closure uses the values that these variables had at the time the closure was created. The Continuation attempts to match the remaining portion (specified by the closure's already-bound arguments) of the pattern against _Input_, starting at the intermediate state given by its State argument. If the match succeeds, the Continuation returns the final State that it reached; if the match fails, the Continuation returns ~failure~.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <em>Matcher</em> procedure is an internal closure that takes two arguments &mdash; a State and a Continuation &mdash; and returns a MatchResult result. A Matcher attempts to match a middle subpattern (specified by the closure's already-bound arguments) of the pattern against _Input_, starting at the intermediate state given by its State argument. The Continuation argument should be a closure that matches the rest of the pattern. After matching the subpattern of a pattern to obtain a new State, the Matcher then calls Continuation on that new State to test if the rest of the pattern can match as well. If it can, the Matcher returns the State returned by Continuation; if not, the Matcher may try different choices at its choice points, repeatedly calling Continuation until it either succeeds or all possibilities have been exhausted.
      </li>
      <li>
        An <em>AssertionTester</em> procedure is an internal closure that takes a State argument and returns a Boolean result. The assertion tester tests a specific condition (specified by the closure's already-bound arguments) against the current place in _Input_ and returns *true* if the condition matched or *false* if not.
      </li>
    </ul>
