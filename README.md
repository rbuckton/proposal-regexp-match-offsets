# RegExp Match Indices for ECMAScript

ECMAScript `RegExp` Match Indices provide additional information about the start and end
indices of captured substrings relative to the start of the input string.

> NOTE: This proposal was previously named "RegExp Match Array Offsets", but has been renamed

An example implementation can be found in [`regexp-measure`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regexp-measure).
> NOTE: `regexp-measure` was built around the Stage 0 proposal and is no longer up to date with respect to
> the current proposed API design.

# Motivations

Today, ECMAScript `RegExp` objects can provide information about a _match_ when calling the `exec`
method. This result is an `Array` containing information about the substrings that were matched,
along with additional properties to indicate the `input` string, the `index` in the input at which
the match was found, as well as a `groups` object containing the substrings for any named capture
groups.

However, there are several more advanced scenarios where this information may not necessarily be
sufficient. For example, an ECMAScript implementation of TextMate Language syntax highlighting
needs more than just the `index` of the _match_, but also the start and end indices for individual
capture groups.

As such, we propose the adoption of an additional `indices` property on the array result (the 
_substrings array_) of `RegExp.prototype.exec()`. This property would itself be an _indices array_ 
containing a pair of start and end indices for each captured substring. Any _unmatched_ capture 
groups would be `undefined`, similar to their corresponding element in the _substrings array_. 
In addition, the _indices array_ would itself have a `groups` property containing the start and end
indices for each named capture group.

# Examples

```js
const re1 = /a+(?<Z>z)?/;

// indices are relative to start of the input string:
const s1 = "xaaaz";
const m1 = re1.exec(s1);
m1.indices[0][0] === 1;
m1.indices[0][1] === 5;
s1.slice(...m1.indices[0]) === "aaaz";

m1.indices[1][0] === 4;
m1.indices[1][1] === 5;
s1.slice(...m1.indices[1]) === "z";

m1.indices.groups["Z"][0] === 4;
m1.indices.groups["Z"][1] === 5;
s1.slice(...m1.indices.groups["Z"]) === "z";

// capture groups that are not matched return `undefined`:
const m2 = re1.exec("xaaay");
m2.indices[1] === undefined;
m2.indices.groups["Z"] === undefined;
